# BuildSysPro open source
*BuildSysPro open source* is [EDF](http://researchers.edf.com/edf-researchers-209799.html)'s Modelica library for buildings, districts and energy systems modelling. This is BuildSysPro's official repository.

**Github project is being created, please be patient!**

### Release updates
Current release is version 2015.12. It is the first open release of BuildSysPro. The flow-based EDF library for fluid modelling is still work in progress and therefore not published yet.
EDF is part of [IEA EBC Annex 60](http://www.iea-annex60.org/), and the [Annex 60 library](https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60) for fluid modelling will be merged in BuildSysPro shortly.
